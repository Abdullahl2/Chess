    <h2 id="Yellow" class="font">THE PAWN</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The Pawn</b> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its ability
      to work with other pawns and to become promoted. Pawn chains can be very
      powerful and a pawn can be promoted to another piece if it reaches the
      other side of the chess board.

    <h2 id="blue" class="font">THE KNIGHT</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The Knight</b> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its
      unique L-shaped movement and ability to jump over other pieces. It is
      impossible to block a Knight.

    <h2 id="red" class="font">THE QUEEN</h2>
    <p>
      <b>The Queen</b> is one of my favourite chess pieces because of its power.
      The Queen can move any number of spaces in any direction!
